CONSTITUTION:A cationic electrodeposition coating A is applied to form a coating film, the surface of the unhardened film is coated with an org.-solvent coating, and both coating films are simultaneously hardened to form a double- layer coating film. The coating A with the coating film loss X controlled to 10wt.% when the dehydrated electrodeposition coating film is heated and hardened is used in this method. The electrodeposited film is not bled and the film is smoothly hardened by this method, and the desired coating film is obtained. The loss X is obtained by performing cationic electrodeposition under ordinary conditions, pulling up the obtained film from an electrodeposition bath, washing the coated surface with water, heating the film at 105 deg.C for 3hr to remove all or almost all the moisture in the film and then measuring the weight of the film. The coating film is then heated at 170 deg.C for 20min and then three-dimensionally cross-linked and hardened, and the weight of the coating film is measured to calculate the loss.",1,0.000527605

The curing agent is a blocked diamine, i.e., a ketimine. The ketimine can be prepared by reacting a carbonyl compound and an aromatic diamine. Water is produced in this reaction.

Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method for forming a multilayer coating film for automobiles, and more particularly, to wet-on-wet using a difference in surface tension between layers by using a specific non-aqueous dispersion in a middle paint and a top coat. A vehicle that can prevent the reversal between layers and the phenomenon of mixed layers, prevent the top coat from being absorbed into the middle coating, and prevent the popping phenomenon during final curing by promoting the middle drying speed. It relates to a method for forming a multilayer coating film. The coating film forming method according to the present invention can make a great contribution to not only energy saving but also productivity improvement and environmental pollutant reduction by shortening the coating process. ‘_µ“üµ, “_‘ª“¡¬, ‘ã“_´, ‘ã‘¤ä, “_É“_¡Ûµ’ªÓ, ‘¦ã“â¡“¥ÁDuplex, Automobile, Painting, Coating, Particle Crosslinking, Dispersion",,0.235797482

SOLUTION: A hard coat layer showing outstanding hard coat properties is applied on the surface of each of various kinds of an object.

When the ratio of Si/C is less than 0.1, this means that the Si content of the hard coat layer is at a low level. Thus the dense polysiloxane part of a polymer forming the hard coat layer is reduced so that the hard coat properties are not developed. In addition, the performance such as wear resistance, impact resistance or durability of the hard coat layer is not enhanced.

In other words, the individual components are not mixed with each other. In the second option of the coating material system according to the invention, conversely, the components may be mixed together in whole or at least partly. If the components are at least partly mixed with one another, this is, for example, mixing component (C) with component (A), while components (B) and (D) are the components (A) and (C). It means that it exists separately from the mixture. Optionally, however, component (B) or (D) may be mixed with a portion of component (C). Furthermore, the mixture of (A) and (C), and the mixture of (B) or (D) and (C) may further contain at least one optional component such as a solvent.  Component (A) contains at least one polyhydroxy group-containing compound having an acid value not exceeding 9 mg KOH / g (corresponding polyhydroxy group-containing compound), and component (B) Contains at least one polyisocyanate-containing compound. Component (C), in contrast, is a catalyst containing bismuth as a metal component, the catalyst being present as a salt of at least one organic acid and component (D) being an aromatic carboxylic acid. The aromatic carboxylic acid of component (D) and the organic acid of component (C) are different from each other. Additional components that may be present in the coating material system of the present invention include, for example, coating additives (F), hydroxyl-containing compounds (G), pigments (H) and / or solvents (J).",,0.312599633

The surface modification on the carbon black pigments results in higher pigment loadings, which, in turn, imparts U.V. light protection at exceptionally low dry film builds. Furthermore, the microgel particles cause the primer to build in viscosity and set up a gel structure in its uncured state, which allows the primer to be overcoated wet-on-wet with automotive topcoat finishes and cured simultaneously in a single bake without diminishing the topcoat appearance and physical properties.
